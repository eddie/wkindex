  "description": "My problem is that the decision was completely out of my hands. My objective is to learn Kanji, and I'm not going to cheat since that wouldn't bring me closer to where I want to be, but Wanikani decides that since some people could cheat if given the chance, I can't be trusted and does not let me correct it when it is wrong. This userscript fixes this problem, by adding an \"Ignore Answer\" button to the footer during reviews. This button can be clicked anytime an answer has been marked as wrong by Wanikani."
